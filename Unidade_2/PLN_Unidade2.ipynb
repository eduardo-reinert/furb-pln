            "Review: Kojima Productions' best project yet is Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, and it's largely thanks to how refined and an improvement it is on its predecessor, rather than being the perhaps expected unconventional sequel. The star-studded cast and their conjoined chemistry have helped craft a more interconnected and personal world this time, only bolstered by the unbelievably gorgeous, detailed and technically impressive open world where every journey is its own story. Every job and delivery is a delight and an immersive challenge against the greater elements. Picking you up off your feet and prodding you along are all the other players' structures and creations around the world. In Death Stranding 2, you are never alone. That remains true whether it's paying respect to those that came before, or paving the future of open world games that Kojima Productions, and even you, the player, are actively doing at all times. What a bright future it is.\n",

            "Review: Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, developed by Kojima Productions and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, is a new journey with a tonal shift compared to its predecessor, as the narrative is smaller in scope and far more personal. On the gameplay side of the tracks, the new game tightens a lot of loose ends from the first game, expands the world of Death Stranding through new environments and gameplay improvements, and exceeds all expectations with how a game should look on PlayStation 5. This is a solid contender for Game of the Year.\n",

It strikes a balance between delivery and action, silence and intensity, all guided by bold creative choices. However, it remains an experience that demands time and engagement.

Nevertheless, for those approaching it with an open mind, there is much to explore, feel, and interpret. It may not appeal to everyone, but it will certainly leave something for those willing to journey through it.\n",

            "Review: Death Stranding 2: On the Beach perfectly captures the spirit of the first game while adding some meaningful new features. These include dialogues that we can now actively engage in, as well as new challenges such as earthquakes and floods, which further emphasize the unpredictability of the post-apocalyptic world. We also really liked the combat system in part 2, which is now a bit more complex and allows us to actively fight human threats and GDs with both armed force and various stealth mechanics. In addition, there are two atmospheric new locations that stand out more from the setting familiar from Part 1 than you might think at first glance, providing a welcome visual change. The biggest selling point of the sequel, besides the great emotional story, is the breathtaking graphics, which clearly show what the PS5 is capable of. The photorealism on display is absolutely stunning, both in the cutscenes and in-game, providing us with landscapes, facial features, and lighting effects that could easily be found in any Hollywood movie. The integration of the DualSense features is also excellently done, allowing us to experience the game world and, in particular, the challenges of the deliveries firsthand. One thing Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and that is the largely slow-paced, almost meditative gameplay. Those who found this too boring in the first installment will quickly come to the same conclusion in part 2. Those who, like me, loved this unique approach to the medium of video games will also be able to enjoy the sequel to Kojima's masterpiece to the fullest.\n",

            "Review: Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a divisive, challenging work that never tries to please everyone. And because of that, it succeeds in leaving a deeper mark. Hideo Kojima returns to talk about connection, but this time he does so in a world that no longer needs to be united: he does so in a world that must learn to live with its own fractures, its own shadows, its own broken memories. It is a video game about mourning and hope, about collective choices and personal sacrifice, but one that manages to remain a game in the purest and deepest sense of the word. Play-wise, the title consistently evolves the original formula, incorporating new mechanics, more dynamic rhythms and a more layered structure, where the narrative and management components meet without ever clashing. Not everything is perfect: some sections still feel too slow, certain gameplay choices may be off-putting to those expecting more continuous action, and some narrative passages risk being overly cryptic. But these are small cracks in a work that manages, once again, to be visionary, fragile, and powerfully human. The technical compartment on PS5 borders on excellence: lightning-fast loading, visual cleanliness, granitic stability, without sacrificing the artistic detail that makes every shot worthy of a photo shoot. DualSense is put to excellent use, as are 3D audio and haptic feedback, making every step, every raindrop, and every beat of the BB's heart a living part of the experience. Ultimately, Death Stranding 2 is much more than a sequel. It is a second work that rewrites the meaning of the first, a new journey that does not erase the previous one but transforms it, reworks it, sublimates it. It is one of those games that asks for trust, time, and a hint of surrender. But if you let go, On the Beach manages to touch chords that modern video games rarely dare to touch.\n",

            "Review: Hideo Kojima set out to craft a timeless yet divisive experience—but in the end, he only succeeded at one. Death Stranding 2 may not spark controversy, but it will be remembered. It’s far from perfect, still echoing some of the original’s flaws, yet it feels profoundly personal—raw, human, and unapologetically honest. More than a sequel, it’s a culmination. A quiet masterpiece that may very well be Kojima’s magnum opus.\n",

            "Review: Death Stranding 2 is part 2 of Death Stranding, not its sequel. The gameplay structure shifts towards greater immediacy in the use of every feature, aspect, and mechanic, particularly with a much more solid combat system—which tends to Metal Gear Solid-ize this IP—and greater ensemble playing among the characters, who are less isolated from each other and more part of a single entity fighting with the past, in the present, in the name of the future. Sam and we cross the mirror together to explore beyond memories and recollections, in a title that is a bit déjà vu and a bit therapy session, as powerful as and more than the first, with its sharp narrative but not without the usual Kojima histrionics, and a bitter but not pessimistic underlying message, because “the future is indeed the sum of all presents, but tomorrow does not belong to today anyway.\n",

It refuses to pander, save for the promise of story continuation, stellar cast, and an evocative soundtrack. But before expanding its world, it should have focused more deeply on refining its gameplay, because the magic of the first game can’t be relived twice.\n",

Even if Death Stranding 2: On the Beach didn’t grip me at first as I had hoped, by the end — much like its predecessor — it left me deeply moved and with a strange, immediate sense of longing. Just hours after finishing it, I started it all over again — not out of a need for completion (which I could have continued from my first run), but simply because I still can’t bring myself to leave this world and these characters. To me, this rare kind of involvement — at once interactive, emotional, and philosophical — is what makes video games such a special form of expression.\n",
